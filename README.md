# One-Div-TLOP
ROFL 

An exercise to recreate Kanye West's album cover for his album "The Life of Pablo" in HTML using only a SINGLE DIV element.  
This was accomplished with gratuitous usage of the text-shadow style, and an "after" pseudo-element.  This was also the dumbest exercise that I've ever embarked on.
